    <p>Copyright is known to save and protect the original owner of a website, from being stolen by another person. Wow, that sounds great, but what is the problem?</p>
    <p>The issue of copyright is how long will the copyright be protected til there's no more protection to your website. For instance, in an article "The Disadvantage of Copyright", states "it does not protect the idea or concept itself. Thus, if you draw a picture of a new type of shower head, others will be prohibited from copying the drawing, but they can still use the basic premise to build an actual shower head".<br />
      This shows that even if we think the copyright is safe, its actually neglect the applicable protect.</p>
